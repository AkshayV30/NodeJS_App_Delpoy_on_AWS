# Node.js Application Deployment with Docker, GitHub Actions, and Terraform on AWS ECS Fargate

This repository demonstrates how to containerize a Node.js application using Docker, push the Docker image to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) using GitHub Actions, and deploy the application on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) Fargate using Terraform.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- GitHub repository for the Node.js application
- Terraform installed
- Docker installed
- Node.js application codebase
--

## Steps

 1. Dockerize the Node.js Application
 2. GitHub Actions for Continuous Deployment
 3. Configure Terraform to deploy AWS Resources
 4. Configure Secrets for Github Actions to trigger


# Conclusion
  By following these steps, you've successfully containerized a Node.js application, set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to push the Docker image to AWS ECR, and deployed the application to AWS ECS Fargate using Terraform. This setup ensures a scalable, reliable,    and automated deployment process.
